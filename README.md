## ‚ú® Features
Complete Graph Editor 
- Click to place - building nodes on canvas
- Drag-and-scroll - canvas for large maps
- Custom naming - for each location
- Visual node weights - representing importance/capacity
- Delete nodes - with intelliget cascading deletion
- Delete edges - individually

## üîó Connection Management 
- Connect buildings with weighted edges
- Set distance and time for each path
- Mark paths as wheelchair accessible ‚ôø
- Toggle paths open/closed dynamically
- Delete connections with confirmation
- Randomize weights for testing

## üîç Pathfinding Algorithms 
BFS (Breadth-First Search) - Finds shortest path by hop count 
DFS (Depth-First Search) - Explores deeply before backtracking 
Animated traversal shows algorithm in action 
Accesible-only mode for wheelchair routes 
Real-time statistics (distance, time, path length)

## üé® GUI
- Modern dark theme with vibrant colors
- Color-coded node effects
- Scrollable control panels

# Usage Guide
## Adding Buildings 
1. Enter a building name in the "Add Building" section
2. Click "üìç Click to Place"
3. Click anywhere on the canvas to place the building
4. Node size represents its weight/importance

## Creating Paths
1. Select "From" and "To" buildings from dropdowns
2. Enter distance(meters) and time (minutes)
3. Check ‚ôø if wheelchair accessible
4. Click "‚úì Add Connection"

## Finding Paths
1. Select Start and Goal buildings
2. Optionally enable "‚ôø Accessible Routes Only"
3. Click BFS or DFS to run the algorithm
4. Watch the animated path traversal!
5. View results with statistics in the output panel

## Managing Connections 
- Toggle Closed: Temporarily close/open a path.
- Toggle Accessible: Change accessibility status.
- Delete Connection: Remove a connection permanently (with confirmation).
- Randomize Weights: Randomize all distances and times.

## Managing Nodes
- View all buildings: See complete list with weights.
- Delete Building: Remove a building and all its connections (with confirmation)
- Randomize Node Weights: Change building importance/capacity values.
- Larger nodes = higher weight/importance

## Algorithm Details 
## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores level by level using a queue (FIFO)
- Guarantees shortest path by hop count
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(V)
- Best for: Finding shortest unweighted paths

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores deeply using recursion (stack-like)
- May not find shortest path but finds a path quickly
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(V)
- Best for: MAze solving, exploring all possibilites
Where V = vertices (buildings), E = edges (path)

## üéìEducational Value
This project demonstrates:

- Graph theory fundamentals
- Search algorithms (BFS vs DFS)
- Data structures (graphs, queues, dictionaries, sets)
- GUI programming with Tkinter
- Animation and visual feedback
- Path reconstruction techniques
- Accessibility considerations in routing
